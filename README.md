# Software Application Development Strategy

## 1. Discovery and Planning Phase:
- **Day 1-5: Stakeholder Interviews**
    * Meet with key business units to understand their needs.
    * Define the primary goals and objectives of the application.
    * Document key features and functionalities required.

- **Day 6-10: Technology Stack Decision**
    * Based on requirements, choose appropriate technologies for frontend, backend, database, and other necessary services.
    * Decide on a Version Control System (e.g., Git).
    * Determine infrastructure needs (cloud-based, on-premises, etc.).

## 2. Design Phase:
- **Day 11-20: Wireframing**
    * Collaborate with the design team to create wireframes for the application.
    * Conduct reviews with business units to ensure alignment.

- **Day 21-40: High-Fidelity Designs**
    * Create detailed mockups and prototypes.
    * Review and iterate based on feedback from business units.

## 3. Development Phase:
- **Day 41-45: Environment Setup**
    * Set up development, staging, and production environments.
    * Configure Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

- **Day 46-100: Application Development**
    * Break down tasks into sprints using an Agile framework.
    * Prioritize tasks according to business needs.
    * Conduct daily stand-ups to track progress and address issues.
    * Ensure proper engineering practices, such as Test-Driven Development (TDD) and code reviews.
    * Engage with business units for regular feedback.

- **Day 101-120: Testing Phase**
    * Engage Quality Assurance (QA) teams to conduct rigorous testing.
    * Address reported bugs and retest.
    * Conduct performance testing to ensure application scalability.
    * Security audit to check vulnerabilities.

## 4. User Acceptance Testing (UAT):
- **Day 121-130: UAT with Business Units**
    * Allow business units to use the application in a controlled environment.
    * Gather feedback and make necessary adjustments.

## 5. Documentation and Training:
- **Day 131-140: Documentation**
    * Document all aspects of the application, including user manuals, technical specifications, and API documentation.
    * Engage with business units to understand training needs.

- **Day 141-145: Training**
    * Conduct training sessions for end-users.
    * Capture feedback and make any final adjustments.

## 6. Deployment and Go-Live:
- **Day 146: Pre-Deployment**
    * Conduct a final review with stakeholders.
    * Backup current systems if replacing an existing application.
    * Ensure all system configurations are ready for production.

- **Day 147: Deployment**
    * Deploy the application to the production environment using CI/CD pipelines.
    * Monitor the application closely for any issues.

- **Day 148-150: Post-Launch Monitoring**
    * Address any teething problems quickly.
    * Set up monitoring and alerting systems for real-time application health checks.

## 7. Ongoing Maintenance and Support:
- **Day 151 onwards: Support and Iteration**
    * Provide ongoing support for the application.
    * Use feedback to release updates and new features regularly.
